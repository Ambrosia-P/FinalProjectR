## Description of the data collection and sources

This data selection examines electricity and natural gas prices during the 2022 European Energy Crisis using data from two authoritative sources covering nine European countries (France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Bulgaria, Sweden, and Finland) from 2019 to 2024.

**Electricity Prices for Household Consumers** (Code: nrg_pc_204): This dataset is sourced from Eurostat and accessible via the [Eurostat Data Browser](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/bookmark/3fc4f5aa-4d49-4ab4-9b16-392cc50555ed?lang=en&createdAt=2025-11-10T18:38:30Z). The dataframe measures electricity prices in euros for all 27 countries of the European Union from 2007 to 2025, with data collected bi-annually. For our purposes, we selected data for our nine chosen countries covering the period from 2019 to 2024, using prices that exclude taxes and levies.

**Dutch TTF Natural Gas Prices**: This dataset is sourced from [Investing.com](https://www.investing.com/commodities/dutch-ttf-gas-c1-futures-historical-data) and provides monthly closing prices in euros per megawatt-hour. The Dutch TTF (Title Transfer Facility) gas market serves as the main benchmark for natural gas trading in Europe, setting the wholesale prices used in most European contracts. This makes it an essential indicator for understanding gas price movements across the continent during the crisis period.
